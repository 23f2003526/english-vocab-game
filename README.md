# English Vocabulary Quiz Game for Class 6

## Overview
This interactive English vocabulary quiz web app is designed especially for Class 6 students (ages 11â€“12). It features multiple-choice questions with four options, only one of which is correct. After selecting an answer, the app provides instant visual feedback: a colorful confetti burst celebrates correct answers, while a sad face animation appears when the answer is incorrect. This encourages engagement and motivation. The app keeps track of your score and offers a friendly summary message upon quiz completion. The vocabulary is carefully chosen to suit the age group.

## Setup
No installation or server setup needed.

1. Download the `index.html` file.
2. Open it directly in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. No internet connection is needed unless loading Google Fonts for styling.

## Usage
- Read the question presented at the top.
- Click on one of the four colored options as your answer.
- If your answer is correct, a confetti animation will celebrate your success and the option turns green.
- If your answer is incorrect, a sad face animation appears briefly and the correct answer is highlighted in green while your choice turns red.
- Your score is updated and shown above the question.
- Click the "Next" button to proceed to the subsequent question.
- After the last question, a summary screen appears with your total score and a motivating message.

The interface uses clear, colorful visuals and animations to keep learning fun and interactive.

## Improvements in Round 2
- Added a full-screen confetti animation using a custom canvas overlay when the user selects the correct answer for festive feedback.
- Implemented a custom sad face animation that briefly shows and fades when the user selects a wrong answer.
- Both animations are lightweight, non-blocking, and enhance user engagement without disrupting quiz flow.
- Improved accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard focus management.
- User interface refined for clarity when displaying feedback and options after answers are selected.
