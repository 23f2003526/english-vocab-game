# English Vocabulary Quiz Game for Class 6

## Overview
This engaging English vocabulary quiz web app is designed specifically for Class 6 students (ages 11â€“12). It features a multiple-choice quiz with questions on vocabulary words suited to this age group. Every new round presents a randomly selected set of 5 questions from a larger bank of at least 20 questions, ensuring a fresh experience each time.

The app provides instant visual feedback: a colorful confetti burst celebrates correct answers, while a charming sad face animation signals incorrect ones. The interface updates your score in real-time and presents a motivating summary at the end of each round. Clear, vibrant design and responsive animations make learning fun and interactive.
